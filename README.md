# General Medical Practitioners

This is a mirror of the General Medical Practitioner data provided by the NHS
[Organisation Data Service](http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/ods)

This is being used for a prototype GP practice lookup - at this time we can't
guarantee that it will be kept up to date.

Note that this data contains only *active* GPs. Further, the same doctor can
appear multiple times, linked to a different practice. Because of the strange
way [General Medical Practitioner codes](http://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/attributes/g/general_medical_practitioner_ppd_code_de.asp?shownav=1)
are allocated, the same person has a different code for each practice they work
at.

The latest JSON data can be found at [https://github.com/nhsalpha/general-medical-practitioners/blob/master/output/general-medical-practitioners.json](https://github.com/nhsalpha/general-medical-practitioners/blob/master/output/general-medical-practitioners.json)
